# lolmastery

## Introduction
LoL Mastery is a web application made for the 2016 Riot API Challenge.
This application will allow you to compare multiple Summoner's mastery.

More informations below.

## Documentation
You can compare Summoner's mastery from any server, just use the "Add Summoner" button to add as many field as you want.

You can also compare Summoner's mastery by Team, by checking the "Team" radio button.
Just enter a Summoner's name and you can choose one team where the Summoner is.

We want to allow you to compare Summoner's mastery by Club, but there's actually no way to do it since Riot haven't developed this feature.
So we will implement it if it come out.
